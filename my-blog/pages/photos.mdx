This application is still in the development stage, later on the application can recognize flower images inputted by users, both photos taken using a camera and photos taken from the gallery. This application can provide recommendations for flower shops that sell flowers that users are looking for in the nearest location. This application also has an additional feature in the form of a catalog of flower types, which can provide information to users about certain types of flowers and how to care for them. My part in this project is backend and cloud engineer, such as building the backend using node.js and deploying to Google Cloud Platform, deploying models, etc. This project is the capstone project of Bangkit Academy from team CH2-PS209.
